  "article": "1 \nINTRODUCTION \nCitation indicates the source of the idea and is often used in the text as in-text citation, used at the end \nof  the  text  as  end-notes  or  used  at  the  bottom  of  the  text  as  foot-note.  Citing  the  source  of  the \ninformation not only honours the original writer but also provides a track that can be used to trace the \ndevelopment and the origin of the idea (Hunter, 2006). For these reasons, Hunter (2006) cautions that \nfailing to cite is not only a violation on the ownership of the person who originated the idea but is also \nakin to stealing. Citation has been reported as an important strategy in establishing the research topic \nin journal articles. Citation is necessary, even during the initial part of the introduction section for the \nreason that citing the previous work of others established the association and connection between the \nnew articles with the existing discussions in the research group being pursued. \nEstablishing a research territory in writing research article refers to the act of giving a lay out on the \nsubject area for the intended research. The subject area is presented in the picture and conveyed to \nthe  reader  before  the  discussion  delves  deeper  into  the  research  niche  and  the  intended  research \n(Swales,  2004).  Research  articles  of  any  discipline  need  to  address  the  general  audience  before \ngetting deeper into the research niche to capture the general readership. The reason is to present to \nthe  general  audience  that  the  research  area  is  of  importance,  is  of  relevance  to  the  current  body  of \nknowledge,  is  interesting  and  has  some  unresolved  problems  that  are  worthy  to  be  explored.  Often, \nthe items of previous research in the area are reviewed to serve the purposes mentioned.  \nWhile  reports  have  shown  that  Malay  writers  of  English  research  articles  have  made  advance \naccomplishments in this practice, little is known on how the Malay language article writers use citation \nin  establishing  the  research  territory  in  the  journal  articles.  A  number  of  English  technical  research \narticles (Khairul et.al, 2014, Othman et.al, 2014 & Warsi et. al, 2014) have been identified to utilized \nthis  strategy  therefore  the  descriptions  on  the  practice  in  the  Malay  research  articles  of  language \n\fdiscipline is called for. Moreover, studies (Adnan, 2009 & Mirahayuni, 2002) on utilization of citations \nin the journal articles of other language than English such as in Thai and Indonesian language have \nindicated  variances  in  the  utilization  of  citation.  The  possibility  of  variances  in  the  utilization  calls  for \nmore  studies  on  the  writings  in  Malay  language  journals,  as  such  description  would  give  a  better \nunderstanding  on  how  the  writers  of  Malay  language  journals  write  hence  may  be  used  to  improve \nteaching and learning methods for this area. \nThis  paper  studies  35  research  articles  published  in  the  Malay  language  journals.  The  findings  from \nthe  text  analysis  are  analysed  for  patterns  particularly  on  the  presence  or  absence  of  citation  in \nestablishing the research territory, on the delay of using citation in establishing the research territory \nand on the critical use of citation. \n1.1  CARS model \nThis  study  uses  CARS  model  by  Swales  (2004)  which  represents  the  prevalent  rhetorical  pattern \n(Suryani,  2015).  CARS  model  has  been  described  as  being  \u201cseminal  in  shaping  genre  theory  in \nEnglish for Specific Purpose (ESP)\u201d (Flowerdew, 2005, p.322), and as a \u201cdominant approach for ESP\u201d \n(Dudley-Evans.  2000,  p.4).  Many  other  researchers  have  also  acknowledged  that  this  model  has \nsuccessfully  described  most  of  the  rhetorical  strategies  in  various  genres  of  research  articles \nintroductions  (Shehzad,  2010,  Suryani,  2015,  Samraj,  2002).While  CARS  model  proposed  3  Moves \nand 13 Steps, this study only looks at the first Move. \nIn 1990, Swales has proposed the Create A Research Space Model (CARS) that suggested the first \nstep of establishing a research territory in writing research article refers to the act of creating a subject \narea for the intended research. The subject area is put in the picture and is conveyed using any of the \nthree steps: Claiming centrality, making topic generalization and review of previous research. Claiming \ncentrality is when the writer puts forward the subject that is in focus. After bringing in the subject, the \nwriter may choose to make the topic generalization where general circumstances and conditions about \nthe  subject  are  given.  The  writer  may  also  review  some  of  the  previous  research  and  include  some \ncitations with regards to the subject being introduced. Bringing in the previous study initiates a link that \nmarks the subject with the existing discussion in the research community. While there are three steps \nin fulfilling this move, the writer may use one of the steps or combine any of the three steps: \nCARS Model version 1990 on Move 1: Establishing a territory \nStep 1:  \nStep 2:  \nStep 3:   \nClaiming centrality, and/ or  \nMaking topic generalization(s), and/ or  \nReview items of previous research  \nAdnan  (2009)  has  suggested  that  at  this  point,  the  strategy  is  to  state  that  the  intended  research \nbelongs to a lively research field; for example an author may state that the field has attracted a lot of \nstudies, or that the subject is considered a complex issue for researchers. \nA  decade  later,  research  article  writing  being  dynamic  due  to  the  rapid  publication  demands  and \ndevelopments  in  technologies  has  undergone  some  changes.  The  revised  model  (Swales,  2004) \nposits  that  in  establishing  a  research  territory,  \u201cliterature  review  statements  are  no  longer  always \nseparable\u201d and for that were released from being \u201cautomatic used as signals\u201d for the independent part \nof move analysis. However, in this revised model, citations are required  and the  topic generalization \nhas the quality of increasing specificity to the intended research. In other words, unlike the 1990 model \nwhere review items of previous research was set as a step on its own as Step 3 in Move 1, the 2004 \nversion  incorporates  the  review  of  previous  research  as  obligatory  support  for  the  steps  on \nestablishing territory and topic generalization with increasing specificity. \nCARS Model version 2004 on Move 1: Establishing a territory \nMove 1  \nEstablishing a territory (citation required) \nVia \nTopic generalizations of increasing specificity,  \nThe  general  uses  of  citation  include  giving  a  narrative  account  on  the  available  information  in  the \nresearch area. Often, past works are stringed together to describe the developments of ideas. On top \nof this, research article writing also calls for analytic and critical use of citation. Critical use of citation \nhas  been  described  as  evaluating  the  existing  studies  with  a  critical  disposition  rather  than  just \n\freporting on what has been done. Using several sources, drawing on the differences and similarities \nare some of ways to incept an analytic point of view (Jeeson & Lacey, 2006).  \nIn establishing the territory of the research, the use of citation is less critical. The critical use of citation \nhas  been  described  as  evaluating  the  existing  studies  with  a  critical  disposition  rather  than  just \nreporting  on  what  has  been  done.    At  this  stage,  the  purpose  of  citation  is more  on  establishing  the \nconnection with the existing body of knowledge and to assert that the topic is of current interest. Often, \nto  capture  the  general  audience,  renowned  researchers  in  the  area  are  mentioned  at  this  point. \nIdeally,  the  generalization  increasingly  narrows  down  to  the  research  niche.  Should  the  writer  dive \nstraight  into  the  research  niche,  the  scope  would  only  capture  a  smaller  number  and  more  specific \naudience. The analysis in this paper looks at both, the general use of citation and the critical use  of \ncitation in establishing the territory of the research. \n2  METHODOLOGY \nThis paper studies 35 research articles published in a Malay language journal which are published in \n2016,  2015  and  2014.  The  research  articles  are  from  3  different  volumes  of  5  publications  of  Jurnal \nBahasa.  8  research  articles  are  taken  from  Jurnal  Bahasa,  Volume  16  Number  2,  Dec  2016.  7 \nresearch articles are taken from Jurnal Bahasa, Volume 16 Number 1, June 2016. 7 research articles \nare  taken  from  Jurnal  Bahasa,  Volume  15  Number  2,  Dec  2015.  6  research  articles  are  taken  from \nJurnal Bahasa, Volume 15 Number 1, June 2015. 7 research articles are taken from Jurnal Bahasa, \nVolume 14 Number 2, Dec 2014. \nfrom \nThe  research  articles  are  retrieved \nhttp://jurnalbahasa.dbp.my/wordpress/?page_id=320.  Next,  the  sampling  index  list  is  created  and  a \nsampling number is assigned to each research article. From then on, the research articles are known \nby their sampling number hence putting aside the information of authorship and affiliation.  \njournal  official  website \nin  Pdf \nformat \nfrom \nthe \nThe reason to keep the article anonymous is to avoid biased in the analysis which may be caused by \nthese  information,  particularly  when  many  of  the  articles  are  written  by  renowned  professors  and \nexperts  in  the  area.    After  that,  the  Introduction  sections  of  the  research  articles  are  put  in  word \ndocument  table  for  analysis.  The  text  analysis  is  done  manually  and  with  the  help  of  the  computer \nfunction.  The  Computer  function  used  is  only  for  the  word  count.  The  rest  of  the  analyses  are  done \nmanually.   \nThe text analysis is conducted in two levels. The first level  is done by a text analyst  who is a native \nspeaker  of  Bahasa  Melayu  who  has  learned  Bahasa  Melayu  throughout  the  primary  and  secondary \nschool  level  and  obtained  A  in  Bahasa  Melayu  subject  for  the  National  School  Certificate  or  Sijil \nPelajaran Malaysia (SPM). While not having an undergraduate qualification in Bahasa Melayu, the text \nanalyst being a native speaker has ample understanding on the fundamentals of applied linguistic in \nBahasa  Melayu    level  as  the  text  analyst  has  a  Bachelor  and  Master  degree  in  English  Language \nStudies; therefore is familiar with the topics and linguistic features in the research articles.  \nThe second level of the text analysis is done by an interrater  with a similar background to the first text \nanalyst.  The  interrater  reliability  is  done  to  confirm  the  understanding  of  the  analysis;  whether  the \nmoves are realized in the research articles and to identify how the moves and steps are accomplished \nin the research articles.  \nFollowing the checking, the discrepancies between the researcher and the interrater are resolved by \nnegotiation.  In this study, the interrater reliability process was conducted on all of the research article \nintroductions. \nThe similarity index between the first rater and the interrater is at 0.84. The discrepancies between the \ntwo  rates  are  reanalysed  and  negotiated.  A  discussion  has  been  conducted  on  the  functional \ncategories  so  that  the  affirmation  by  both  raters  could  be  achieved  on  the  disagreements  (Gwet, \n2010).  Following the example set by Sheldon (2011), the remaining differences are resolved through \ndiscussion and clarification and finally the similarity index is at 0.91 \nThe  findings  are  analysed  for  patterns  particularly  on  the  presence  or  absence  of  citation  in \nestablishing the research territory, on the delay of using citation in establishing the research territory \nand on the critical use of citation.  \n3 FINDINGS AND DISCUSSIONS \n\fIn this section, the explanation for the rhetorical strategy on establishing a territory is given and then, \nthe  percentage  of  occurrence  for  this  strategy  is  presented  and  compared  to  the  findings  from  the \nother studies.  Next, the patterns on the presence or absence of citation in establishing the research \nterritory are reported. After that, the findings on the delay of using citation in establishing the research \nterritory and on the critical use of citation are discussed. Finally this section describes three identified \ntechniques that have been used to realize the strategy of establishing a territory in the corpus. \n3.1 FINDINGS ON ESTABLISHING THE RESEARCH TERRITORY \nEstablishing  a  research  territory  in  writing  research  article  is  a  rhetorical  strategy  that  is  meant  to \ndisplay to the general audience that the research area is of importance, is relevant to the current body \nof  knowledge,  interesting  and  has  some  unresolved  problems  that  are  worthy  to  be  explored.  The \nresearch topic  is introduced  as being useful  and  worth studying. The  writer  would further hinted that \nthe  research  area  is  well  established,  relevant  and  important  to  the  wide-ranging  audience  as  to \ncapture as many readership as possible. \nThe  analysis  on  the  rhetorical  strategy  of  establishing  a  territory  has  indicated  that  88.6%  of  the \nresearch articles have started off by establishing the territory of the research. Despite the advantage \nof using this strategy, the findings shows 11.4% of the authors have preferred to skip this strategy thus \nforgoes the benefits of promoting the intended research area as important, worth studying and most of \nall, relevant to a wide range of readership.  \nSheldon (2011) has suggested that occurrence at a percentage of 80% and above indicates that the \nstrategy is being practiced as an obligatory strategy and a percentage of below 80% suggests that the \npractice  is  an  optional  strategy.  Swales  (2004)  has  suggested  that  establishing  a  research  territory \nand the use of citation at this stage is an obligatory strategy. Following the suggestion by Sheldon, the \npercentage  of  88.6%  found  in  this  study,  it  is  suggested  that  the  strategy  is  being  practiced  as  an \noptional  strategy  instead  of  as  an  obligatory  strategy  as  suggested  by  Swales  (2004).  While  the \nanalysis has indicated that this strategy is deemed as an optional strategy by the writers in this study, \nthe text analysis cannot justify why the authors has choosen to dive straight into the niche area of the \nstudy instead of beginning the research article by giving an overview of the research.  \nComparing  the  findings  of  the  study  with  the  other  studies  (Suryani,  2015,  Sheldon,  2011)  indicates \nthat  the  rhetorical  strategy  of  establishing  the  research  territory  proposed  in  CARS  model  (2004)  in \nresearch  articles  of  this  study  is  underutilized.  The  research  articles  in  this  study  are  in  Malay \nLanguage  and  when  it  is  compared  to  the  research  articles  written  in  English  by  Malaysian  writers \n(Suryani 2015), the percentage of this study is lower.  \nOnly 88.6% of the authors in this study has attempted this strategy compared to 94% which is found in \nthe  previous  study  on  English  research  articles  written  by  academicians  in  Malaysian  universities  in \nComputer  Science  discipline    published  in  international  journals  indexed  in  Scopus  (Suryani,  2015). \nThe Malaysian writers in this study are using the strategy as an optional strategy while the Malaysian \nwriters of the English research articles are using this strategy as an obligatory strategy. Even though it \nis  arguable  that  the  differences  can  be  due  to  the  different  practices  between  Science  and  Arts \ndiscipline,  the  percentage  of  this  study  is  also  lower  when  it  is  compared  to  the  study  by  Sheldon \n(2011). \nThe  study  by  Sheldon  (2011)  is  also  on  research  articles  of  similar  discipline  to  this  study  which  is \nLanguage discipline. The applied linguistic research articles in the study are written by Spanish writers \nin Spanish, for national readership as such has similar purpose and discipline to the research articles \nin this study. Sheldon (2011) has found that 94.44% of the Spanish writers have utilized this strategy. \nCompared to the finding of this study at 88.6% it can be  derived that the Spanish writers  have used \nthis strategy as an obligatory strategy while the Malaysian writers have use this strategy as an optional \nstrategy. Once more, the comparison indicates that this strategy is being underutilized by the writers in \nthis study.  \nOn  a  similar  note,  Ahmad  (1997)  has  conducted  a  study  on  62  research  articles  written  in  Malay \nlanguage by Malaysian writers published in Malaysian journals namely , Pertanika, Sains Malaysiana \nand Jurnal Teknologi. The occurrence of the strategy in the study (Ahmad, 1997) is at 98%  which is \nalso  higher  than  the  percentage  found  in  this  study.  Ahmad  (1997)  has  detailed  out  that  in \naccomplishing  the  strategy  of  establishing  the  research  territory,  the  writers  has  devoted  more \nsentences compared to the other two strategies suggested in CARS model (Swales, 1990).   \nOn the other hand, the percentage found in this study is higher than the percentage found in a study \non  linguistic  research  articles  written  by  Indonesian  writers  in  Indonesian  language  (Adnan,  2009). \n\fAdnan (2009) has found that only 33.3% of the Indonesian writers from linguistic discipline attempted \nthis  strategy  as  well  as  only  4.76%  by  those  in  education  discipline.  Mirahayuni  (2002)  also  has \nreported on the  underutilization of this strategy by  the Indonesian  writers and  has reasoned  out  that \nthe  Indonesian  writers  are  more  oriented  towards  the  local  space  and  time  rather  than  the  general \ndiscussion  in  the  area  of  study.  The  writers  are  focused  and  centred  to  their  own  research  and  the \nnational scope.  \n3.2 FINDINGS ON THE USE OF CITATION \nA  closer  look  on  the  citation  count  shows  that  only  65.7%  of  the  corpus  has  cited  the  works  of  the \nothers in establishing the territory of the research. Citing the previous work of others often establishes \nthe association and connection between the new articles and the existing discussions in the research \ngroup  being  pursued.  The  findings  indicated  that  34.3%  of  the  research  articles  have  missed  the \nopportunity  to  connect  with  the  previous  studies  and  to  participate  in  the  general  discussion  of  the \nexisting research.  \nCARS  model  (2004)  has  prescribed  that  the  use  of  citation  for  this  strategy  is  obligatory.  Given  that \nthe percentage of this study at 65.7% is farfetched from the obligatory percentage of 80%, intervention \non  the  teaching  and  learning  of  research  article  writing  for  this  group  an  be  done.  Correspondingly, \nMirahayuni  (2002)  and  Adnan  (2009)  also  have  reported  that  the  Indonesian  writers  reviewed \nliterature  that  situate  their  study  amongst  other  studies  much  less  than  the  native  English  RAs  as \nsuch, are less effective in situating their study in the existing body of knowledge. \nThe  general  use  of  citation  includes  providing  description  related  to  the  topic  of  the  study,  giving \ndefinition related to the study and commenting on the general topic of the study. Relatively the critical \nuses of citation entail pointing out the problem of the study, highlighting the research gap and justifying \nthe need of the study. The analysis on the research articles in this study shows that citation is mostly \nused  to  provide  description  related  to  the  topic  of  the  study.  It  is  found  that  65.7%  of  the  research \narticles  accomplished  this  purpose.  On  a  similar  note,  Adnan  (2009)  has  reported  57.91%  of  the \nresearch article in Indonesian language uses citation to provide background information. \nAlmost  77.14%  the  research  articles  make  the  citation  in  the  first  five  lines  of  their  introduction \nsuggesting that there is only a limited delay in the use of citation for the Malay writers. However not all \nof the citations made in the first five lines at are used to established the territory of the research. The \ncitations have been used for other purposes.  \nThe  next  prevalent  purpose  for  citing  is  to  give  definition  related  to  the  study  which  is  attempted  in \n62%  of  the  research  article.  Only  14.3%  of  the  research  articles  use  citation  to  comment  on  the \ngeneral  topic  of  the  research.  The  critical  use  of  the  citation  to  point  out  the  problem  of  the  study  is \nonly at 17.1%, to highlight the research gap is only at 34.3% and to justify the need of the study is only \nat  25.7%.  Adnan  (2009)  who  also  found  limited  critical  use  of  citation  suggests  that  the  possible \nreason for the small number of attempt could be due to the belief that writing research article does not \nrequire such practices and lack of awareness in the strategies described in CARS model.  \nDISCUSSION \nThe lower percentage found in this study suggests that the strategy on establishing the territory of the \nresearch can be further promoted amongst the Malay writers of this genre. The possibility of skipping \nthe  strategy  could  be  due  to  the  specialization  of  the  journal.  Journal  Bahasa  is  a  journal  that \nspecialized in Malay language and linguistic. It is published by  Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka  twice a \nyear  in  Jun  and  December.  The  first  publication  was  in  March  2001  and  it  is  indexed  in  MyJurnal, \nMyCite  dan  Islamic  World  Science  Citation  Centre.  The  target  readership  groups  are  linguist, \nlanguage  teachers,  scholars  and  academics.  The  relevant  topics  for  discussion  are  terminologies, \ndiction, grammar, dialectology, entomology, spelling, database and vocabulary. \nGiven  the  area  of  specialization,  the  expected  readerships  are  academics  and  researchers  who  are \ninterested in the area. Having such specialized readership, the authors may have an impression that \nthe  readers  are  familiar  with  the  niche  area  and  therefore  has  little  need  to  dwell  on  the  general \nissues. However, studies on highly cited research articles show that this strategy has been put to use \nby  the  other  writers.  Writers  of  highly  cited  research  articles  who  were  also  writing  in  specialized \njournals with specific readership opt to utilize this strategy. The authors state the research territory by \ngiving a general overview of the issue being discussed.  \n\fOn top of this, the authors also use citation to connect the attempted research with the existing body \nof  research.  While  it  is  not  to  generalize  the  link  of  using  this  strategy  with  being  highly  cited,  the \nstrategy  of  establishing  the  research  territory  using  topic  generalization  do  capture  a  bigger  general \naudience.  Citing  the  previous  works  done  in  the  research  may  also  capture  some  readership \nparticularly  those  who  have  followed  the  earlier  works.  For  this  reason,  the  authors  of  the  Malay \nlanguage  articles  may  benefit  by  citing  the  earlier  works  when  establishing  the  territory  of  their \nresearch area. Such practice not only attracts the existing follower but also link the intended research \nwith the existing body of knowledge.",
