Quantum Bits: The Building Blocks of Quantum ComputingAt the heart of quantum computing are qubits, which, thanks to the phenomenon of superposition, can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This unique property allows quantum computers to process a vast number of possibilities in parallel, leading to an exponential increase in computational power compared to classical computers.Entanglement: Quantum Computing's Secret SauceEntanglement is another fundamental quantum principle that sets quantum computing apart. When qubits become entangled, the state of one qubit becomes directly linked to the state of another, regardless of the physical distance between them. This interdependence enables quantum computers to solve certain problems more efficiently than classical computers.Quantum Supremacy: A Milestone Achieved. In recent years, there has been a race among researchers and tech giants to achieve quantum supremacy—the point at which a quantum computer can outperform the most powerful classical computers.
